PersonalWebsiteGuide
====================

A guide I created to help my non-programmer friends understand the fundamentals of creating and locally deploying a simple static portfolio website.

<h2>FIRST STEPS: STUFF TO DOWNLOAD</h2>

Step 1: Sign up for [Github.](https://github.com/join) It's the best way to continually save your code to the internet (in "repositories"), so you can see your progress, backup your files, and collaborate with others. Think of it kinda like Dropbox for programmers, except anybody can see your stuff.

Step 2: Download GitHub for your computer - [here for mac users](https://mac.github.com/), [here for windows users](https://windows.github.com/). Once downloaded, open it up and sign in.

Step 3: Download [Sublime Text 2.](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) It's basically Microsoft Word for programming. (Note: they ask you to purchase it for $70, but the free trial is unlimited, so interpret that how you will...). Open it up.

Step 4: Go to https://github.com/zachboyette/PersonalWebsiteGuide (if you aren't already here), and click "Download Zip" ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/x7fmpJc))

Step 5: Decide what website template you want to use. I have four pre-made ones for your convenience. See what they look like: [Style A](http://stylea.recsy.com), [Style B](http://styleb.recsy.com), [Style C](http://stylec.recsy.com), or [Style D](http://styled.recsy.com). Remember which one you like - we'll come back to this later.

<h2>NEXT STEPS: GETTING STARTED</h2>

Step 6: Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository for your personal website ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/uGnC0zM)). Make sure to leave it "Public," and tick the option for "Initialize this repository with a README." After it redirects you to the next screen, click "Clone in Desktop" in the bottom right corner ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/pC1KFZC)). This will open the GitHub client for your computer that you downloaded in Step 2. Click "Clone," without changing any of the settings in the box that pops up ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/XphOo0O)).

Step 6: Open the zip file from Step 4. Double click the folder of the Style you chose from Step 5. Copy all of these files ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/1POoAuH)). Now, using Finder or Windows Explorer, find the folder for the repository you created in Step 6 ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/Cs20Cou)), and paste your Style files into this folder ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/wG4unpi)).

Step 7: Go back to the GitHub client on your computer. You'll see lots of "NEW" representing the files you just pasted into your repository. Enter a brief description for "Summary," then click "Commit & Sync" ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/RWJ15Ey)). This will save your code to GitHub.

<h2>CHUGGING ALONG: START MAKING YOUR WEBSITE</h2>

Step 8: Using Finder or Windows explorer, double click on the "index.html" file within the folder for your personal website ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/5nwKrXq)). This will let you view it on your local browser (i.e. just your computer, not the internet). 

Step 9: Drag the entire folder for your personal website from Finder/Explorer down into the Sublime Text 2 icon ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/5AhAnw0)). Once Sublime Text opens up, click on "index.html" from the left, and you should see something like this: [screenshot](http://imgur.com/KNFDrLb). 
Congratulations! After this step, most of the tricky parts are out of the way.
NOTE: For your knowledge, the index.html file is the fundamental backbone for a website. It contains all the text and very basic "markup" information. 

Step 10: So you should have your template open locally in a browser from Step 8. Pick a random sentence like to change. Now, go back into index.html on Sublime Text, and find that sentence. Change it to whatever you'd like (for example, change "Hi my name is John Doe" to "Hi my name is Peter Griffin." Save the index.html file. Now go hit refresh in your browser on your locally deployed website and, voila! You'll see the changes you made.

Step 11: Go back to GitHub on your computer. It will be displaying the change(s) you made. Once again, as in Step 7, write a short "Summary" then click "Commit & Sync" ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/z34MP24)).

<h2>NOW WHAT? MAKING IT YOUR OWN</h2>

Step 12: At this point, if you know HTML and CSS, you'll be able to edit your website as you see fit. Otherwise, feel free to just change pieces of text in the index.html file, and watch them come to life on your browser. Don't worry if you don't know HTML and CSS - there are plenty of websites like www.codecademy.com to help you learn the syntax.

Step 13: Continue commiting your changes to GitHub as you edit your website. You don't need to do it after every change you make - just after you've been working for a while.


Onward: when I have more time, I will continue this guide to teach you how to deploy your website onto the internet.
