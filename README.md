PersonalWebsiteGuide
====================

A guide I created to help my non-programmer friends understand the fundamentals of creating and locally deploying a simple static portfolio website.

<h2>FIRST STEPS: STUFF TO DOWNLOAD</h2>

Step 1: Sign up for [Github.](https://github.com/join) It's the best way to continually save your code to the internet (in "repositories"), so you can see your progress, have backups of your files, and collaborate with others. Think of it kinda like Dropbox for programmers, except anybody can see your stuff.

Step 2: Download GitHub for your computer - [here for mac users](https://mac.github.com/), [here for windows users](https://windows.github.com/). Once downloaded, open it up and sign in. Click the + icon in the top left and create a new repository ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/hWzJky6)). This is where you'll store your code on GitHub. Note: only enter something for "Name," and let it automatically fill in "Local Path."

Step 3: Download [Sublime Text 2.](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) It's basically Microsoft word for programming. (Note: they ask you to purchase it for $70, but the free trial is unlimited, so interpret that how you will...). Open it up.

Step 4: Go to https://github.com/zachboyette/PersonalWebsiteGuide (if you aren't already here), and click "Download Zip" ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/x7fmpJc))

<h2>NEXT STEPS: GETTING STARTED</h2>

Step 5: Decide what website template you want to use. I have four pre-made ones for your convenience. See what they look like: [Style A](http://stylea.recsy.com), [Style B](http://styleb.recsy.com), [Style C](http://stylec.recsy.com), or [Style D](http://styled.recsy.com). Remember which one you like - we'll come back to this later.

Step 6: Open the zip file from Step 4. Double click the folder of the Style you chose from Step 5. Copy all of these files ([screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/1POoAuH)). Now, using Finder or Windows Explorer, find the folder for the repository you created in Step 2 ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/xwhwauZ)), and paste your Style files into this folder ([screenshot](http://imgur.com/ySm8tyA)).

Step 7:
