PersonalWebsiteGuide
====================

A guide I created to help my non-programmer friends understand the fundamentals of creating and locally deploying a simple static portfolio website.

<h2>FIRST STEPS: STUFF TO DOWNLOAD</h2>

Step 1: Sign up for [Github.](https://github.com/join) It's the best way to continually save your code to the internet (in "repositories"), so you can see your progress, have backups of your files, and collaborate with others. Think of it kinda like Dropbox for programmers, except anybody can see your stuff.

Step 2: Download GitHub for your computer - [here for mac users](https://mac.github.com/), [here for windows users](https://windows.github.com/).

Step 3: Download [Sublime Text 2.](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) It's basically Microsoft word for programming. (Note: while they ask you to purchase it for $70, the free trial is unlimited, so interpret that how you will...)

Step 4: Go to https://github.com/zachboyette/PersonalWebsiteGuide (if you aren't already here), and click "Download Zip" [screenshot for reference](http://imgur.com/x7fmpJc)

Step 3: Decide what website template you want to use. I have four pre-made ones for your convenience. You can use [Style A](http://stylea.recsy.com), [Style B](http://styleb.recsy.com), [Style C](http://stylec.recsy.com), or [Style D](http://styled.recsy.com). Remember which one you like - we'll come back to this later.
